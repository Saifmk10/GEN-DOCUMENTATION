# GEN-DOCUMENTATION
A VS Code extension that automatically analyzes your project’s codebase and generates a clean, structured, and always-up-to-date README.md. Uses a Python backend + LLMs to understand your code, track changes, and build documentation that evolves as you develop. Zero manual writing, zero outdated docs — your project explains itself.
